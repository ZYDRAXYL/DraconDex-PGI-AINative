// Same content as catalog.json, as a plain JS assignment instead of a fetched
// file: a file://-loaded plugin window cannot fetch() or XMLHttpRequest a
// sibling file at all (Chromium treats a file:// page as an opaque "null"
// origin and refuses both APIs outright — confirmed against the real
// Electron plugin window, not just a theoretical CORS rule) but CAN load a
// <script src> same as app.js/style.css already do. Keep this identical to
// catalog.json — everything after 'window.CATALOG = ' up to the trailing
// `;` must stay valid JSON on its own, so scripts/check-catalog-sync.mjs can
// verify the two never drift apart without a JS parser.
